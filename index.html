                <h1>Yiskah Yvonne</h1>
                <p>As a Mathematics undergraduate at Florida Gulf Coast University, I am deeply passionate about cryptography, computer science, and machine learning. My academic focus includes studying algorithms and cryptographic principles to design security frameworks that address contemporary challenges.</p>

                <p>I am particularly interested in applying these principles within blockchain and quantum  technologies to enhance data privacy, fortify digital defence mechanisms, and ensure secure transactions. My goal is to develop robust, scalable solutions that safeguard communications and data across diverse technological environments.</p>

                <p>By integrating advanced cryptographic algorithms and multiple technologies, I hope to engineer cohesive security systems that can withstand the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.</p>
